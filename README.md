# StackOverflow-Tag-Prediction
This was a recruiting challenge hosted by Facebook on Kaggle. This competition tests NLP skills on a large dataset from the Stack Exchange sites. The task is to predict the tags (a.k.a. keywords, topics, summaries), given only the question text and its title. The dataset contains content from disparate stack exchange sites, containing a mix of both technical and non-technical questions.
